## Philosophy

Here is the main principle to keep in mind with every conventions we create at Ouest-France.

> Don't create conventions you can't enforce

In other word, don't create conventions that **are not** or **can't be** **automatically** enforced. You will forget, someone will forget. We are human, we are unreliable. Here is two talks on that subject: [Development Principles and Philosophy](https://www.slideshare.net/FGRibreau/development-principles-philosophy) and [Automatic constraints as a team maturity accelerator for startups](http://fr.slideshare.net/FGRibreau/automatic-constraints-as-a-team-maturity-accelerator-for-startups)
